I read The Year in Review by Dave Barry today, and I highly recommend it. The piece is hilarious—but it’s the kind of laughter that you quickly realize is really just a coping mechanism.

The post opens with a raccoon found passed out on the bathroom floor of a store, apparently after consuming a rather impressive amount of alcohol. The photo went viral, the raccoon became a celebrity, and Barry suggests that the success of our hero has a lot to do with how much the image represents us. As Dave puts it, we are all sprawled on the bathroom floor of history, “between the wastebasket of stupidity and the commode of broken dreams.”

From there, the text moves month by month, recapping the successive absurdities of the U.S. political scene at the start of Trump’s second term. It’s such an outrageous inventory that, if it were fiction, it would feel overdone.

        The image of the drunken raccoon works because it fits our own sensibilities at this moment: it’s not about heroic anger, nor mobilizing outrage. It’s exhaustion. Confusion. A mix of disbelief and moral hangover. In a world that seems to have lost any real commitment to reasonableness, the dominant feeling is simply, “How did we end up here?”

        That may be why the raccoon became a symbol. Because it captures the emotional state of those who have gone well past the limits of what’s tolerable and are now just trying to stay conscious on the cold floor of the present. And Dave's post is well worth reading. Laughter helps — even if it’s that slightly crooked kind of laughter, from someone who’s still trying to get back up...
