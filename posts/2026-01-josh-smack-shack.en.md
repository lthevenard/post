# That Night We Went to Josh’s Smack Shack (And It Felt Like a Seinfeld Episode)

If someone had told me last week that on Saturday night I’d find myself standing in a freezing industrial lot in Maryland, waiting in line for a burger, I probably would have laughed. And yet… that’s exactly what happened when my co-advisor and I made the pilgrimage to Josh’s Smack Shack — the viral smashburger phenomenon that’s been getting people to endure hours of cold and confusion just to eat a burger.

## What on Earth Is Josh’s Smack Shack?

Josh’s Smack Shack started out of a shared commercial kitchen in Rockville, Maryland, and before long it became a social media sensation. People have been lining up — sometimes up to two hours in sub-freezing temps — just to try the Shack’s smashburgers, like the double “Smack,” the triple-patty “Bubba,” and even a quadruple-stacked monster called the “Goonzinator.”

The Shack’s founder, Josh Muñoz, apparently got the idea while playing Fallout 76 — where someone was selling stuff out of a shack — and thought, “hey, that could be a food business.” True story.

**We Showed Up, Reality Hit.**

So there we were, driving into what looked like the Bermuda Triangle of abandoned warehouses (maybe actually the Rockville Industrial District) around 7 PM. The Shack is basically a window in a garage-like space — almost no seating to speak of, except for a picnic table, and no ambiance. Oh, and, by the way, no sides either (they were out until Wednesday). Just the most amazing burgers (or so the internet promised).

The vibe? Somewhere between a guerrilla food pop-up and a contraband exchange in a late-night drama. We arrived early enough that the crowd wasn’t huge yet, but folks were already waiting — bundled up, checking watches, and emitting occasional looks that said, what did I get myself into? At one point, the couple ahead of us, after waiting over 30 minutes just to place an order, turned back into the cold with a smirking “good luck,” as if leaving the queue of the Soup Nazi (no burgers for you!).

Behind us, the line swelled as the night deepened and temperatures dropped.

    <h2>The Kramer Moment</h2>

        Then I realized that pinned to the wall next to the order window was a picture of Kramer (yes, that Kramer). It was an image from an episode in which a fancy artist makes a oil paiting with a portrait of Kramer. Honestly, it felt like the universe was winking at us — this entire experience was basically an episode of Seinfeld: absurd, minorly soul-crushing, and disproportionately elevated by social hype.

        Some episodes — the Soup Nazi, the Yogurt Place with No Calories, the infamous black and white cookie standoff — always seemed exaggerated to me. Over the top. Not realistic. But there I was, in a parking-lot-turned-burger-theater, living out the real-world equivalent of those scenarios — right down to the bizarre social norms that emerge when people wait in line for something that may or may not be “worth it.”

## The Burger (Spoiler: It Was Good)

After what felt like both an eternity and a blink, we got our orders. We both decided on The Bubba — triple smashed patties with caramelized blackened beef bacon, house sauce, onions, and pickles. It was dirty (in the best possible way), messy, rich, and extremely flavorful. Worth the wait? Honestly? Probably. But I suspect half of that pleasure came from the absurdity of the situation, the company, and the shared delirium of everyone else trying to stay warm.

We sat at that picnic table, surrounded by others still in line, who now had to watch us chowing down while chatting about this surreal experience.

    <p><strong>So… Worth It?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Yes, the burger was legitimately tasty. But the experience — the lines, the isolation, the social performance of enduring it all — that’s what made it unforgettable. It definitely felt like we stepped into an episode of Seinfeld where the joke was on all of us. But don't be mistaken: we were definitely one of the cool kids now! So, so hipster...

        Next time someone mentions going viral over a food item, I’ll ask them if it involved frostbite and a picture of Kramer on the wall first. If yes, count me in!
