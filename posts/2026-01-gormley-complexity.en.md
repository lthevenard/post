# The Complex Concept of Complexity: A Note on Gormley’s Typology

One of the most elegant things about [William Gormley’s classic typology](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.2307/3234884) is its simplicity. By crossing *salience* (low vs. high) with *complexity* (low vs. high), Gormley gives us four ideal types of policymaking and rulemaking processes. It’s a neat framework, intuitive, and still very influential.

But that elegance comes with a cost — and the weak point, in my view, is complexity.

Salience is relatively easy to grasp and, more importantly, to observe. A policy issue is salient when it attracts attention: media coverage, mobilization by organized civil society, intense lobbying, protests, campaigns, or widespread public debate. You may argue about thresholds, but the underlying idea is straightforward. Attention is attention.

Complexity, on the other hand, is a much trickier beast. One could say... well... it's complex!

## 1. Complexity can be hard to define (and even harder to measure)

What exactly makes a policymaking process “complex”? Is it the number of variables involved? The level of technical expertise required? Legal density? Economic modeling? Institutional interdependence?

Once these questions are taken seriously, it becomes apparent that many — perhaps most — public policies could plausibly be described as complex. They tend to involve multiple interests, legal constraints, economic trade-offs, and institutional interactions. This makes complexity a less discriminating concept than it may initially appear.

## 2. Complexity is, to some extent, subjective

A second difficulty is that complexity is rarely absolute. It is often experienced differently by different actors.

What appears highly complex from the perspective of regulators or technical experts may be understood in much simpler terms by other stakeholders. This does not necessarily reflect misunderstanding or ignorance. It often reflects the use of simplifying models — selective representations of reality that focus on what certain actors consider most relevant.

Models, after all, work precisely because they reduce complexity. Like maps, they omit most details in order to highlight a few relationships that matter for a particular purpose. Highly technical issues can be framed, understood, and debated in surprisingly simple terms by specific groups. From this standpoint, complexity is at least partly a matter of perspective: complex for whom, and according to which criteria? Indeed, a process may look unbearably complex to insiders and yet appear perfectly intelligible — even obvious — to those experiencing its consequences.

## 3. Complexity can be used strategically

A third point follows from the previous two. Because complexity is difficult to define and unevenly perceived, it can sometimes be invoked strategically.

Emphasizing the technical nature of a policy process may discourage participation by actors who lack specialized expertise, even when those actors have legitimate stakes in the outcome. In this sense, complexity can function as a gatekeeping device — not necessarily by design in every case, but with real consequences for who feels entitled to participate and whose contributions are treated as relevant.

This matters normatively, especially in regulatory settings. Independent agencies are insulated from electoral politics, yet they routinely make decisions with significant economic and social effects. In such contexts, popular pressure is not inherently inappropriate; it is one of the ways democratic systems express accountability outside elections.

## A concrete example: energy tariffs and public participation

We may see these issues contretely if we look at a [public consultation](https://antigo.aneel.gov.br/web/guest/audiencias-publicas-antigas?p_auth=pCfeIRL2&p_p_id=participacaopublica_WAR_participacaopublicaportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=2&_participacaopublica_WAR_participacaopublicaportlet_ideParticipacaoPublica=305&_participacaopublica_WAR_participacaopublicaportlet_javax.portlet.action=visualizarParticipacaoPublica) conducted by Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (ANEEL) on electricity tariffs charged by CEMIG, a case I analyzed in my master’s thesis.

From a technical standpoint, the process could easily be classified as highly complex. It involved sophisticated tariff formulas, numerous variables, a detailed concession contract, and overlapping legal, economic, and institutional considerations.

At the same time, public participation was intense. Many consumers approached the issue through a much simpler lens: electricity tariffs in their state were higher than elsewhere in the country, and this seemed to indicate that something needed to change. 

The technical details of the adjustment formula were not central to their reasoning. They did not engage in complex economic analyses, did not offer technical evidence to support their claims, they just demanded a big reduction of electric energy tariffs, quite vehemently in fact, as can be seen in the [footage of the public heering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzNYFKWAtaI).

This situation can be interpreted in different ways. One view is that the problem was genuinely complex and that public contributions were therefore overly simplistic and of limited technical value. This was the interpretation I emphasized in my master’s dissertation, where I showed that in some cases participants do not ‘speak the same language’ as the agency, which generally reduces the effectiveness and usefulness of their contributions.

However, a more charitable interpretation is that consumers were focusing on what mattered most to them, and that expecting detailed engagement with contractual minutiae may be unreasonable from a democratic standpoint.

Under this second reading, appeals to technical complexity risk serving as a way of sidelining politically meaningful concerns. The issue is not that expertise is unimportant, but that labeling a process as “too complex” may implicitly delegitimize forms of participation that are substantively reasonable, even if they are not technically sophisticated.

## A Cautious Takeaway

None of this implies that Gormley’s framework is unhelpful. It remains a valuable way of organizing variation in policymaking environments. The point is more modest: complexity is a fragile axis. It is difficult to define, partly subjective, and open to strategic use.

Taking these limitations seriously can help us use the typology more carefully — and remain attentive to how claims about technicality shape participation, authority, and democratic legitimacy in the regulatory state.
