The Trump Administration’s U.S. DOGE Service proposed to use AI to rescind 50% of all federal regulations by January 2026. Much of the reporting has focused on the legal implausibility of that plan. But the proposal also highlights a more interesting question: can AI be used constructively to support regulatory reform—particularly in ways that replicate successful state-level models like Virginia’s recent regulatory modernization efforts?

Virginia has adopted a structured approach to regulatory modernization: identify requirements, classify them, assess burdens, and make targeted changes. The approach is data-driven and iterative, rather than a blunt “delete half” approach. AI tools could help scale this kind of work.

One opportunity is to break the Code of Federal Regulations down by level of obligation. Many regulatory provisions are not actually mandatory requirements. Some are discretionary (“may”), and some are definitional, procedural, or explanatory. An AI tool could scan and classify CFR provisions at scale to create a more precise map of what is truly mandatory.

This classification could support a more sophisticated “heat map” of regulatory burden and legal fragility. For example, AI could identify where the CFR relies on:

• Ambiguous statutory language or weak delegations;
• Guidance-like provisions embedded in binding text;
• Requirements driven primarily by executive orders or judicial decisions rather than statutes;
• Areas where major questions concerns are more likely to arise.

AI could also help regulators spot where agencies are incorporating private standards by reference—an important transparency problem. By identifying these incorporations and summarizing the referenced materials (to the extent possible), AI could make the regulatory landscape more accessible.

Another possibility is using AI to compare regulatory approaches across jurisdictions. If other countries or states address similar problems, AI tools could help identify differences and potential best practices.

Finally, AI can support retrospective review. Agencies often struggle to systematically review and update existing rules. AI could help identify outdated provisions, duplicative requirements, and areas where compliance costs appear high relative to benefits.

None of this is automatic. The Virginia model works because it is embedded in a process with human judgment, political accountability, and iterative learning. AI can support that process, but it cannot replace it.
