This post is the tenth contribution to Notice & Comment’s symposium on AI and the APA. For other posts in the series, click here.

In a recent Washington Post scoop, it was revealed that the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had proposed a plan for agencies to use AI to draft and enact deregulation at a dramatically faster pace. Notably, in the DOGE slides, there was mention of using AI to comply with the APA’s notice-and-comment process. This might sound appealing to many, especially academics who criticize the notice-and-comment process as being overly burdensome or ineffective. But how effective would a fully AI-driven notice-and-comment process be at serving § 553’s central goal of improving the final rule?

To answer this question, imagine a world in which HUD decides to use AI to comply with § 553’s procedural requirements. Using public comments as the input, AI drafts the notice of proposed rulemaking, summarizes and responds to comments, and drafts the final rule. The agency’s work is then reviewed by a human, and then published. How effective would § 553 be at improving the final rule adopted by HUD?

From the public’s perspective, the rulemaking process might seem—if anything—even more transparent and responsive than usual. For example, HUD might be able to provide more individualized responses to more comments than usual by using AI to draft its replies; or it might provide an exceptionally detailed notice of the proposed rulemaking. Furthermore, it’s possible (perhaps even likely) that the agency’s heavy use of AI could go completely unnoticed, given the sophistication of generative LLMs and their ability to mimic tone and style. In this way, any additional detail provided in the notices would be attributed to greater attention and care from agency decisionmakers.

In reality, however, the process could be quite superficial. While HUD may have given the impression of “perfect” compliance with § 553, in reality, it’s possible that no one at the agency read even the best comments in their entirety, truly reflected on them, conducted any follow-up investigation, or discussed their impact on the proposed rule with others. Yes, at least one person must have reviewed the AI-drafted notice summarizing and responding to each comment. But this seems a far cry from really engaging with the substance of the comments, as required by the APA (this is especially true depending on the specific AI prompt used to generate the draft, see infra). In sum, in a world where LLMs have suddenly made reading, summarizing, and drafting quite “cheap,” § 553 might miss the mark by treating the written word as a proxy for intellectual engagement.

APA critics might counter that even when humans carry out § 553’s procedural requirements, they don’t necessarily engage deeply with public critique. Some scholars argue, for example, that agencies become extremely “dug in” and attached to their proposed rules early in the rulemaking process. Having put in a significant amount of work long before public commenting begins, agencies can fall prey to the “sunk cost” logical fallacy. Consequently, even human decisionmakers may not sincerely consider public comments or adjust their regulations in response to these comments.

But even if this is true—which is somewhat unclear as an empirical matter—there’s still reason to believe that extensive use of AI (as proposed in the HUD hypothetical) could make this problem far worse. For one, even if an agency has a pre-determined conclusion or regulation in mind, the act of writing out a defense can create cognitive dissonance that leads to a change of heart. In contrast, if AI is used to write even a first draft, this cognitive dissonance may be avoided, regardless of whether or not the agency specifically intended so.

Even worse, an agency with the intention of ignoring public comments could use AI prompts to do so more effectively. Imagine, for example, an agency prompting an AI to specifically “rebut and reject all critical comments” (rather than, more neutrally, “respond to each comment”). By embedding the conclusion into the prompt, agencies could deploy a nearly perfect closed-mindedness that is traditionally difficult to achieve. A manager at HUD can always direct a lower level employee to draft a response rebutting a comment; but there’s also always the chance that the employee develops qualms while drafting, especially in light of their own understanding of the rule and the broader regulatory context. In contrast, generative AI tools do not have this broader context or moral sense to push against the “manager” they “work” for. Indeed, many generative AIs have actually developed highly sycophantic tendencies. Thus, even well-intentioned, neutral prompts could produce more closed-minded drafts than the equivalent work of human writers.

Finally, while these critiques presume that the existing notice-and-comment process has value, even staunch critics of § 553 may have reason to be cautious about AI. As discussed above, APA critics argue that the procedural requirements of § 553 have become overly burdensome, preventing agencies from being nimble and responsive in their regulations. But if agencies can suddenly comply with § 553 easily, thanks to AI, the argument that the APA’s procedural requirements must be reduced to free up agency resources becomes much weaker. In this way, over-automation of the notice-and-comment process could actually have the effect of freezing the APA’s current procedural requirements, but with even fewer substantive benefits than currently exist (for all the reasons discussed above). Even worse, if comments submitted to agencies are also increasingly drafted with AI, the entire process could devolve into a total pretense: machines “speaking” with other machines without any real human intermediation.
