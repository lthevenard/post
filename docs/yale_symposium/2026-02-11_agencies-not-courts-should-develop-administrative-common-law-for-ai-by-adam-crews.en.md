The use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) in administrative decisionmaking is likely to generate new issues in administrative law. Litigants will ask courts to determine whether agencies must disclose their use of AI, explain how AI tools work, or modify procedures to account for AI’s risks.

One way courts might respond is by developing new “administrative common law” rules tailored to AI. But this would be a mistake. Today’s Supreme Court is skeptical of judge-made procedural requirements, and Vermont Yankee limits courts’ ability to impose additional procedures beyond the APA’s text. If courts try to build a new AI administrative common law, the project may be unstable and could provoke backlash.

Instead, agencies—not courts—should develop the standards that will govern AI in administration. Agencies can adopt internal policies, guidance, and documentation practices. Over time, these practices can become customary baselines that courts can recognize and enforce.

Administrative law already uses custom and practice. Courts sometimes look to how agencies typically behave to assess what is reasonable, what process is due, and what explanation is adequate. Agencies are also better positioned to experiment with practices and update them as technology changes.

The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) can help by studying agency AI use and recommending best practices. Cross-agency coordination and iterative learning are especially important because AI systems evolve quickly.

Courts should be cautious about inventing doctrine, and instead should enforce emerging administrative practices. This approach keeps the primary policymaking role in the executive branch while still preserving judicial review.
